# APPFL MNIST Example

This example demonstrates a simple MNIST training example with a server and two clients communicating using gRPC.

I'll assume basic familiarity with Docker Compose, but you can start / stop the example using:

```sh
# start the example
docker compose up

# stop and cleanup the example
docker compose down
```
